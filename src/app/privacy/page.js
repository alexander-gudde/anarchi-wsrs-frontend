        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 8/21/2026</p>
        <p><strong>Business Name:</strong> AnarchI Technologies</p>
        <p><strong>Website:</strong> https://anarchi-tech.com</p>

        <p><strong>Business Address:</strong> 3850 S Meridian Ave, Wichita, KS 67217</p>
        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          AnarchI Technologies (“AnarchI,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) provides deterministic software
          services, including Wallet Safety Reports. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
          use, protect, retain, disclose, and delete information when you visit our website,
          purchase a report, submit a wallet for review, or otherwise interact with our services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our operating principle is simple: <strong>we do not need your seed phrase, we do not
          need your private keys, and we do not take custody of your funds.</strong>
        </p>
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
        <p>When ordering a Wallet Safety Report, you may provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First and last name</li>
          <li>Email address</li>
          <li>Optional phone number</li>
          <li>Public wallet address</li>
          <li>Blockchain network or chain selection</li>
          <li>Customer concerns, worries, or reason for requesting the report</li>
          <li>Additional remarks you choose to submit</li>
          <li>Questionnaire responses used to tune report depth and context</li>
          <li>Report unlock password, used for encrypting or preparing delivery of your report</li>
          <li>Consent choices, including internal research consent</li>
          <li>Terms of Service and safety/risk policy acknowledgments</li>
          <li>Optional wallet proof information, such as a signed message</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.2 Public Blockchain Information</h3>
        <p>
          A public wallet address may be associated with publicly available blockchain information,
          including transaction history, token approvals, contract interactions, visible token balances,
          NFT or token activity, and public source matches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blockchain data is public by design. However, when a public wallet address is linked to
          your name, email, phone number, or report request, we treat that combined information as
          sensitive customer information.
        </p>
        <h3>2.3 Payment Information</h3>
        <p>
          Payments are processed through Stripe Checkout. When you pay by card, bank, wallet, or another
          eligible Stripe-supported method,
          payment information is handled by Stripe. AnarchI does not intend to store full card
          numbers, card security codes, or raw bank credentials on our servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may receive and store limited payment-related records, including payment status,
          checkout session ID, payment provider reference ID, amount, currency, timestamp,
          payment method category, customer email associated with checkout, and dispute or refund
          metadata needed to operate the service.
        </p>
        <h3>2.4 Technical Information</h3>
        <p>
          We may collect limited technical information such as IP address, browser type, device type,
          operating system, referring page, pages visited, timestamps, error logs, security logs,
          and abuse-prevention signals.
        </p>
        <h3>2.5 Information We Do Not Want</h3>
        <p>Do not submit any of the following to AnarchI:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Seed phrases</li>
          <li>Private keys</li>
          <li>Recovery phrases</li>
          <li>Full wallet backup files</li>
          <li>Exchange passwords</li>
          <li>Banking passwords</li>
          <li>Social Security numbers or government identification numbers unless specifically required for a lawful reason</li>
          <li>Information about another person that you are not authorized to submit</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>Confirm payment and prevent unpaid report generation</li>
          <li>Process intake forms and customer requests</li>
          <li>Generate personalized, read-only wallet safety analysis</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>4. Customer Reports and Internal Research Versions</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Customer Report</h3>
        <p>
          The customer report is the personalized report created for you. It may include your public
          wallet address, selected chain, questionnaire answers, concerns, findings, recommended
          actions, and wallet-specific observations. This version is intended for delivery to you.
        </p>
        <h3>4.2 Transactional and Support Record</h3>
        <p>
          We may retain limited records needed for payment confirmation, fraud prevention, customer
          support, tax, accounting, dispute resolution, service auditing, and legal compliance.
        </p>
        <h3>4.3 Sanitized Internal Research Version</h3>
        <p>
          If you consent, AnarchI may create a sanitized internal research version after your customer
          report is delivered. This version is intended to remove or reduce personal identifiers and
          preserve useful generalized safety patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sanitized internal research version should not include your name, email, phone number,
          report password, private customer notes, payment details, or unnecessary direct personal
          identifiers.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Legal Bases and Consent</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your location, our legal basis for processing information may include performance
          of a contract, your consent, legitimate interests such as fraud prevention and service security,
          and compliance with legal obligations.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We may share information with service providers that help us operate AnarchI, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Payment processors, such as Stripe</li>
          <li>Hosting providers</li>
          <li>Database providers</li>
          <li>Email delivery providers</li>
          <li>Security, logging, and abuse-prevention providers</li>
          <li>Professional advisors</li>
          <li>Law enforcement, regulators, courts, or other parties where legally required</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell customer report data.</p>
        <h2>7. Payment Processor Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Payments may be processed by third-party providers. These providers may collect, process,
          store, and protect payment data under their own privacy policies and legal obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Stripe payments, Stripe may collect and process personal data as described in Stripe’s
          own privacy notices, policies, and agreements. AnarchI may receive limited payment status
          and transaction metadata from Stripe to confirm payment, provide support, process refunds
          or disputes, and maintain business records.
        </p>
        <h2>8. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          We may use cookies or similar technologies for website functionality, security, checkout flow
          continuity, analytics, abuse prevention, preference storage, debugging, and performance monitoring.
        </p>
        <h2>9. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>
          We take security seriously and aim to use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational
          safeguards appropriate to the type of information we handle.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTTPS/TLS encryption in transit</li>
          <li>Server-side access controls</li>
          <li>Environment variable protection for secrets</li>
          <li>Separation of frontend public variables from backend secrets</li>
          <li>Encryption or protected storage for sensitive report-delivery material</li>
          <li>Limited access to operational systems</li>
          <li>Avoidance of raw card storage on AnarchI servers</li>
          <li>Audit and error logging</li>
          <li>Rate limiting and abuse prevention</li>
          <li>Report sanity checks before customer delivery</li>
          <li>Sanitization checks before internal research storage</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>10. Wallet Safety and Customer-Controlled Actions</h2>
        <p>
          AnarchI reports may include recommended actions, such as reviewing token approvals, revoking
          risky allowances, checking contract permissions, or using third-party tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          AnarchI does not take custody of your wallet or assets. Any wallet action must be reviewed
          and approved by you through your own wallet or chosen tool. If AnarchI provides transaction
          hints, scripts, links, or action cards, they are informational and customer-controlled.
        </p>
        <h2>11. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain information only as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this
          Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
        </p>
        <h2>12. Your Privacy Choices and Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, object to,
          withdraw consent, or request a copy of certain information. To make a privacy request, contact
          us at <strong>admin@anarchi-tech.com</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>13. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          AnarchI and its service providers may process, transfer, or store information in countries other
          than your country of residence. These countries may have data protection laws that differ from
          your local laws.
        </p>
        <h2>14. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          AnarchI services are not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal information
          from children under 13, or under the applicable age of digital consent in their jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <h2>15. Automated Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Wallet Safety Reports may use deterministic software, automated checks, source matching, scoring
          logic, and report-generation systems. Automated analysis may assist in identifying wallet risk
          patterns, public source matches, approval concerns, and recommended next steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Automated analysis may be imperfect. A report is not a guarantee that a wallet is safe,
          compromised, recoverable, compliant, or free of future risk.
        </p>
        <h2>16. No Financial, Legal, Tax, or Custodial Advice</h2>
        <p>
          AnarchI Wallet Safety Reports are informational and technical in nature. They are not legal advice,
          financial advice, tax advice, investment advice, forensic certification, insurance, or a guarantee
          of wallet safety.
        </p>
        <h2>17. Third-Party Links and Tools</h2>
        <p>
          Reports or website pages may link to third-party tools, explorers, payment processors, approval
          checkers, wallet interfaces, or blockchain resources. We are not responsible for third-party
          privacy, security, accuracy, or practices.
        </p>
        <h2>18. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we may update
          the effective date and, where appropriate, provide additional notice.
